This application was used as our Final porject for Mobile App Development


This project utilizes the programming languages Dart and Flutter.
We implemented the use of a mobile phone emulator to create a functional mobile application

The mobile application was this idea of a Route finder.
Imagine planning a vacation and trying to figure out some areas of interest and things to do at the place you will be at.
This Route Finder app will help in assiting people in finding different routes to follow. The user has access to any route that was previously created. They can choose a route and follow it to explpore an adventure.
The user also has access to create their own routes. The user can pinpoint certain locations to create a landmark and potenatially put many landmarks to create a Route for other users to use.

Within the app you also have access to editing the routes that you have created. You can delete a landmark, add another landmark. Change names and etc.
